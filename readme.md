## What is Make your Combo?

Make Your Combo is a web app created in pure Python with Reflex, a full stack web developing framework.
This web app is made for those who love fighting games, share combos with their friends, or teach them, but often forget what are the notations for the inputs.

## How does Make your Combo Work?

First, in the index, you will be prompted to select one of the, for now, two games that are available (more to come!).

- Once you're inside, you will be greeted by this UI, wich is easy to use, intuitive and fully responsive:

- Then, click some buttons! You can select the character too. For now it has no use, but will have it soon. (will update readme when the feature is done). Once you pressed some buttons, they will appear in "Your Combo" section.

- You can also use some text to describe de conditions for your combo, wich will be added to the final image. If you don't want that, you can just leave it empty! Once that's done, simply click Download Combo and you will be able to download your final image.
